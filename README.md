# React Evaluations 

Evaluating different react patterns.
- all demos use typescripts and smoke tests
- [x] typescript and smoke tests
  - repo: ts-smoke-tests
  - basic example with a counter counter component 
  - uses `useState` hook
- [ ] bootstrap 
  - [x] react-bootstrap 
    - very tedious to use all the components
    - noticed that Navbar.Brand didn't behave the way `.navbar-brand` in bootstrap behaved, with regards to text color
    - have to navigate between 2 docs: bootstrap and react-boostrap
  - vanilla-bootstrap
- [ ] tailwind 
- [ ] auth with hooks 
- [ ] http calls 
- [ ] presentation components .
- [ ] modules layout
